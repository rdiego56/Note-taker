* For this assignment I was required to do a note taker to keep track of notes

* When launching the app I am presented withe the main page where it says get started

* When you click on get started you are then taken to the notes page where there should be some preset notes already

* You are able to write notes on the page, ones the title and description are put thena save icon will appear allwoing you to save

* When you lcick on the save icon then the task will be then saved on the left hand side

* When I then want to delete the note I am then able to click on the delete icon where it will delete the tasks starting from the top

* When I finish entering a task once saved it will refresh which will allow me to entewr a new note
